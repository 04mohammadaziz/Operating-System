To capture a detailed record of all interactions with this custom shell, the script command has been employed. The output of this command is stored in a file named test1.txt.

For the first test, we executed the ls command. The expectation was to see a list of files and directories present in the current directory. 
The shell produced the expected output, listing files like hello, shell, shell.c, and Makefile. Therefore, this test passed successfully.

The second test involved using the cd command to change to the directory /home/20maa2/. 
The shell successfully navigated to the specified directory without producing any output, which was the expected behavior. Hence, this test also passed.

The third test was to print the current working directory using the pwd command. 
The shell successfully displayed /home/20maa2/elec377-tues-pm-60/lab2, which was the current directory. The test was successful.

The fourth test ran a local program named hello by executing ./hello. The expected output was "Hello 20maa2", and the shell did produce this exact output. 
Therefore, the test was successful.

For the fifth test, we ran the ls command by specifying its full path, /usr/bin/ls. 
The shell executed the command successfully and listed the files and directories in the current directory, including Makefile, Program_Description.txt, hello, and so on. 
This test confirmed that the shell can handle commands with their full path, and thus it was successful.

The last test involved running an invalid command, this_is_not_a_command. The shell appropriately responded with "Command not found," which was the expected output. 
This test confirmed that the shell handles invalid commands gracefully and was therefore successful.

In conclusion, all the tests produced the expected outcomes, validating that the custom shell is functioning correctly. 
The script command captured all these interactions, and the logs are stored in test1.txt.
