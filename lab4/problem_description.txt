Problem Statement:
The requirement is to create a script that lists the processes running on a Linux system,
similar to the 'ps' command, but with the ability to format and display additional process-
related information using the '/proc' filesystem.

Solution Description:
Our script, named ps.sh, reads directly from the /proc directory, which contains
detailed information about all currently running processes. It extracts the process ID, user
and group ownership, and command information for each process. The script also supports
additional command-line arguments to control the output, such as -rss for showing
resident set size, -comm for the command name, and -command for the full command line
used to start the process. It also has an option -group to display the group information. 
The script formats the output in a tabulated form for easy reading.
