This document outlines the testing methodology and results for the Linux Kernel Module developed to display the current process's PCB information.

Manual testing was performed by running the cat command as both a regular user and as root.The actual output matched the expected output for all test cases.
The Kernel Module works as expected, displaying the correct process attributes based on the user's permissions.

This section outlines the test cases executed to validate the functionality of the Linux Kernel Module designed to display the current 
process's PCB information.

Test Cases

Test Case 1: lab1.out1 - Run as a regular user
Purpose: To verify that the module correctly displays the attributes of the current process when run as a regular user.
Command: cat /proc/lab1 > lab1.out1
Expected Output: Display of current process attributes with user-level permissions.

Test Case 2: lab1.out2 - Run as root
Purpose: To verify that the module correctly displays the attributes of the current process when run as root.
Command: sudo cat /proc/lab1 > lab1.out2
Expected Output: Display of current process attributes with root-level permissions.

Test Case 3: lab1_dd.out - Run using dd command
Purpose: To verify that the module works correctly when accessed by a different command (dd in this case).
Command: dd if=/proc/lab1 of=lab1_dd.out
Expected Output: Display of current process attributes with user-level permissions.

Completeness of Testing
The test cases cover the following scenarios:

Running the command as a regular user.
Running the command as a root user.
Running the command using a different utility (dd).

These scenarios ensure that the module behaves as expected under different conditions and permissions.
