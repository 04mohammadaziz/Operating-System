The problem involves creating a Linux Kernel Module that provides information about the current process's PCB. The aim is to display
various attributes of the current process, such as its name, PID, PPID, state, user and group IDs. The code uses the 'seq_printf' function
to write formatted data to the seq_file object. It fetches the current process's attributes like comm, pid, state, and cred and displays them.
The Kernel Module successfully displays the required information about the current process. This exercise helped in understanding how to work 
with Kernel Modules and the /proc filesystem.
